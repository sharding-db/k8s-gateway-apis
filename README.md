# Purpose of this repo

Our project is using go1.18, and we're going to use kubernetes gateway apis's newest version, but it's using newer go version and introduces many unnecessary dependencies. So we make this repo to put all api types here to:
- avoid unnecessary dependencies
- make sure we can use whatever go version we want
